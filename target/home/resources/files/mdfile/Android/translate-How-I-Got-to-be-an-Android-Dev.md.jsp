<h1>我的安卓开发者之路以及我在其中学到了什么</h1>
<p>They say all relationships go through a rough patch at two, seven, then ten years. I don't remember who said it, but someone told me that many years ago.
别人都说所有的关系都是需要经历2年、七年甚至十年的磨砺的。我忘了是谁说的这句话，但肯定有人在几年前这么跟我说过。</p>
<p>Next week will be my moving-to-Sydney second anniversary, so I figured this is a good time to write this post.
下一周是我来悉尼两周年的日子，所以我想当前正是我写这篇文章的好时候。</p>
<p>During I/O last May, I met one of the coolest ladies ever, Yasmine. She asked me how I got into Android development, and when I was done telling her she said I should blog about it. So here it is, Yasmine. Better late than never. ;)
去年五月份参加 I/O年会的时候，我遇到了亚斯曼女士，她十分漂亮。她向我请教我是如何成长为一名安卓开发者的，当我跟她说起我的经历时，她认为我应该写个博客记下来。所以亚斯曼，如你所愿，虽然迟了点，但好过没做。;)</p>

<h3>In the beginning...</h3>
<h3>故事的开始</h3>
<p>If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I find it very hard to make decisions. Who's your best friend? What's your favourite food? What should you name your stuffed panda? I don't know the answer to these things. So imagine 16-year-old me, about to graduate high school, and I had Zero Idea what I wanted to major in. The first university I applied to? I wrote down what major I was applying for right in front of the registrar, literally before handing her my application form (Business Economics).
如果有件事你需要了解我的，那就是我发现自己有选择困难症。你最好的朋友是谁？你最喜欢的食物是什么？你应该给你的玩具熊猫命名吗？我连这些问题都不知道该怎么回答才好。所以你可以想象得到，16岁高中毕业的我对于专业选择根本就没有任何想法。那我最初申请的大学是？在交表给注册员前，我在她面前逐字掂量着写下这个打算申请的专业（商业经济学）。</p>
<p>I ended up going to another school, majoring in Electronics and Communications Engineering. I had one computer programming subject in freshman year. And I hated it. I hated it with a passion. I couldn't figure how anything works, and I swore I would never do that again.
可我最后去了另外一间学校，就读电子与通信工程。大一时我有一门计算机编程课程。但我很讨厌编程，十分的讨厌。关于编程的一切我都一无所知。我曾发誓再也不会干这种事了。</p>
<p>My first job after uni was with Intel as a product engineer. I worked there for two years. Lived in the middle of nowhere, worked long hours. But I thought that's par for the course; part of being an adult is working hard, right? And then the semiconductor industry in the Philippines started flipping out. A lot of other factories closed down, some of the products we used to look after were being transferred to other sites. I decided I'd rather look for another job now, than being retrenched and not knowing how long I will be jobless for.
我大学毕业后的第一份工作是在英特尔做产品工程师并在那呆了两年。我很迷茫，无所适从，整天长时间工作。这在我意料之中，身为成年人难道不该努力工作吗？可之后菲律宾的半导体行业开始呈现颓势，大批工厂纷纷倒闭，以前由我们维护一些产品被转移到其他分公司。我便决定去找另一份工作而不是等着被裁员，因为被裁员后我都不知道自己多久才能找到另一份工作。</p>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<h3>现在呢？</h3>
<p>I wanted a job back in the city, and I kinda don't want to stay in a sinking industry. But then again, there is nothing else I know how to do. Yeah, I am a licensed engineer, so technically I could work for a telco, or a TV station even! But at that time, if you want to for a telco, you'd have a better chance of getting hired if you interned with them right out of uni. And I didn't, so that's out. There were a lot of job postings for software developers though. But I hated programming! I don't know how to do it!
我想留在城市里找到一份工作，但我不想呆在正在下沉的半导体行业里了。但话说回来，我又不知道该做什么好。对了，我可是拿了毕业证书的工程师，所以技术上来说我可以在电信运营商或电视台找到工作。可这种时候，如果你想入职电信运营商，应该在大学毕业之际去他们那实习，你就能有一个好的录用渠道，可惜我没有，所以我放弃了这个想法。虽然有是很多软件开发人员的招聘信息，但我讨厌编程，所以我真的不知道怎么做才好。</p>
<p>And this is when my first lucky break came. I am so fortunate that I met a manager who trusted in me. I was upfront with her, I don't know shit. I would have to learn on the job, so it would be a slow start. Needless to say, I learned a lot in that job. I worked on some pretty cool stuff (we made apps installed in SIM cards), and met a lot of really nice people. But more importantly, it kickstarted my foray into software development.
接下来是我第一个幸运的机遇，我很幸运地遇到了信任我的上司，我也和她坦诚了我什么都不会。之后我不得不学习以胜任这份工作，一开始这个过程很漫长。无需多言，我在这份工作上学到了很多，也结识了很多很好的人，与我一起是一群很厉害的同事（我们曾开发出安装在 SIM 卡上的 APP）。但更重要的是我开始踏上了软件开发的征途。</p>
<p>I eventually worked on more enterprise-y stuff (boring). Until the time we ran out of projects. I mean I'm all for coming in puttering around the office doing nothing and getting paid for it. But after two days it turns out that it kinda sucks. It was 2009 and I keep on hearing about this new OS from Google called Android and that the SDK is Out Now! and that You Should Try It Out. So I installed all the things and started Android-ing.
最后我做得更多是一些公司的琐事（十分无聊）直到项目完结。换句话说，我总在是在办公室里闲逛并坐等发薪。之后我发现这确实是在浪费时间，2009 年的时候，我不停地接触到关于谷歌的新系统 Android 的消息，并得知它的 SDK 已经公布！是时候尝试一波了。于是我安装了所有相关软件并着手 Android 开发。</p>
<h3>Things Get Interesting</h3>
<h3>事情变得有趣了</h3>
<p>So now that I have built a shiny, new Hello World app that runs on an emulator, I took that as a sign that I have the creds to apply for an Android development job. I joined a start up, and again, I was upfront about it -- I don't know how to do this, I have just been playing around, but if you want to pay me to play around, then we can be friends. And so I was met with another lucky break.
所以现在我能够构建一个在运行在仿真器的 Hello World 应用，在我看来意味着我有胜任安卓开发工作的能力。我加入了一个创业公司，并且再次坦诚我不知道该怎么做，我只是接触过一些；但如果你们愿意付薪水给我继续尝试，我们就可以成为朋友。然后我很幸运地遇到另一个机遇。</p>
<p>It was an encouraging time to be a dev. The Android Dev StackOverflow community was much smaller, we are all learning at the same time, and honestly, I think everyone was kinder and more forgiving+.
那时成为开发者是一件令人欣喜的事。安卓开发的 StackOverflow 社区非常小，我们都在相互交流学习，说真的，我认为里面的所有人都很友好、很豪迈（注 1）。</p>
<p>I eventually worked for a company whose mobile team is distributed across offices in Manila, Sydney, and New York. I was the first Android developer in the Manila office, but by then I was so used to it that I didn't mind.
我最后去了一家企业，这家企业的移动开发团队在马尼拉、悉尼、纽约都设有办公地点。而我是马尼拉办公地点的第一个安卓开发人员，但那时我很习惯，并没有在意。</p>
<p>It was there that I met the guy who would eventually refer me to Domain, and for that I am forever grateful to him. Domain has done so much for me, both personally and professionally. I work with a really talented team, and I have never seen a company love a product so much. Domain made my dream of attending IO a reality, and through my work with them I got to work on a lot of pretty sweet features that I never dreamed of++. Another lucky break, and I mean to make the most out of it.
在那里我认识了最后令我永远感激的引荐我参与 Domain 项目的人。Domain 项目不管在个人或职业上对我来说都意味深重。我和一支很有才华的团队一起共事，也从没见过一个公司能如此执着于一款产品。Domain 让我实现了参加 IO 年会的梦。与他们共事后我懂得了很多之前没想到的可爱特性（注 2）。另一个幸运的机遇，我是说最大限度地利用它。</p>
<h3>And?</h3>
<h3>然后呢？</h3>
<p>I guess what I mean to say is that I have just been winging it all these years. But at least I'm honest about it, right? It there's anything I have learned, it is that there is nothing wrong with saying &quot;I don't know&quot;. There are times when we need to pretend to know things, but there are a lot more times when we need to accept that we do not know things.
我想说的是虽然这些年都在晃荡，但至少我很诚实，对吧？如上就是我所学到的全部东西。说一句「我不懂」没什么可怕的。有时候我们是该装懂，但大部分时间我们需要坦诚地接受这样一个事实：我们还不懂。</p>
<p>Do not be afraid to try something new, no matter how scared it makes you feel. Easier said than done, I know. But sometimes it really helps to take a deep breath, close your eyes, and just jump+++.  Lundagin mo, baby!
别害怕尝试新事物，不管它让你感觉多害怕。我知道说比做简单。但总有一些东西能让你鼓起勇气动手去尝试的（注3）。Lundagin mo, baby!（LCTT 译注：一首歌名）</p>
<p><code>+</code> I was looking at my old StackOverflow questions, and I seriously think that if I asked them today, I would have a lot of &quot;What are you, stupid?&quot; comments. Or maybe I'm just old and cynical. I don't know. The point is, we have all been there, so be kind to another, okay?
注 1：我查找过我以前提问的 StackOverflow 问题，认真地想想如果现在我问他们这些，估计会收到很多「你是谁啊，傻瓜」的评论。我不知道是不是因为我老了，而且有些愤世妒俗。但关键是，我们有缘在同一个社区中，所以大家相互之间友善些，好吗？
<code>++</code> This merits a post all on its own
注 2：这一点写在另一篇文章里了。
<code>+++</code>  I distinctly remember that's how I applied to my first Android job. I wrote my cover letter, proof read it, hovered my mouse over the Send button, took a deep breath, then clicked it before I could change my mind.
注 3：我还清晰地记得申请第一份安卓开发职位的情形：我写完求职信后又通读了一遍，提交前鼠标在发送按钮上不断徘徊，深呼吸之后我趁改变主意之前把它发出去了。</p>
