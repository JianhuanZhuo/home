<p>Had the same problem. My Solution was a Build Update of Windows. I had the Build Number 10240. (You can check this by Win-Key + R and typing winver) then i just googled &quot;Microsoft creation tool&quot;. The first link was the microsoft page for the ISO download. There it showed a banner for an Update to a newer build. Which i did. Now the card (Driver) works.
Hope that this helps</p>
